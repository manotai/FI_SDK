Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However , the Company may
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting conside rations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or
interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Compan y may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments, and may designate these instrume nts as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company ’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may enter into forward contracts, cross-currenc y swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. As of June 25, 2022, the Company’ s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized
within 20 years.
The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accountin g hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in
foreign curre ncy exchan ge rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’ s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www .apple.com, and its investor relations website,
investor .apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance
matters, and details related to the Company’ s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not
incorporated by reference into this filing. Further , the Company’ s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only .
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday
demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product
introductions can also impact the Company’ s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product
launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Fiscal Period
The Compan y’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September . An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’ s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’ s fiscal years
2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively .
Quarterly Highlights
Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Com pany’ s total net sales, which decreased 1% or $1.2 billion during
the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPad and
iPhone, partially of fset by higher net sales of Services.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Compa ny believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and
continued access to debt markets, will be suf ficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’ s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Compa ny utilizes several outsourcing partn ers to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’ s products and to perform final assembly and testing of
finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company , which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June 25, 2022, the
Company had manufac turing purchase obligations of $43.1 billion, with $43.0 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’ s manufacturing purchase
obligations are primarily noncancelable.
In addition to its contra ctual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase progra m authorized by the Board of Directors (the “Program”). The
Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 25, 2022, the Company’ s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per
share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of finan cial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’ s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’ s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Signific ant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to conden sed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Company’ s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’ s
critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K.

in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States
accounted for 65% and 62% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and 64% and 71% of
total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.
Our customers include original equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system builders, system integrators, add-in board
manufacturers, retailers/distributors, automotive manufacturers, tier-1 automotive suppliers, and other enterprises.
Sales to Customer A represented 12% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and sales to Customer B represented 11% of total
revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple original
equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. Our sales to Customer A
and Customer B were largely in support of two End Customers. One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and
17% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have
represented approximately 13% and 10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of
these End Customers were primarily attributable to our Compute & Networking segment.
Our estimated Compute & Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain concentrated.
In the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, there were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023,
one customer represented 10% of total revenue, primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
Gross Margin
Our overall gross margin increased to 74.0% and 70.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, from 53.6%
and 55.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023,
30respectively. The year over year increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to improved product mix
from Data Center revenue growth of 279% and 156%, respectively, and lower net inventory provisions and related charges.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $681 million and $1.39 billion for the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted
in a provision release of $239 million and $372 million, primarily from Ampere GPU architecture products, for the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.4% and 2.6% in the third quarter and
first nine months of fiscal year 2024.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $702 million and $2.01 billion for the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted
in a provision release of $21 million and $59 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. The net effect on
our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.5% and 9.3% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.

from cloud service providers, or CSPs, including GPU-specialized CSPs; consumer internet companies; and enterprises. Our sales of
Ampere GPU architecture-based Data Center products were significant but declined sequentially, as we approach the tail end of this
architecture. We recognized initial revenue on the ramp of our L40S GPU and the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip for a broad range of
customers. CSPs drove roughly half of Data Center revenue, while consumer internet companies and enterprises comprised approximately the
other half. Networking was up 155% from a year ago and up 52% sequentially, almost entirely due to strong growth in InfiniBand infrastructure to
support our HGX platform.
Gaming revenue was up 81% from a year ago and up 15% sequentially. Strong year-on-year growth reflects higher sell-in to partners following
normalization of channel inventory levels. Sequential growth reflects strong demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for back-to-school
and the start of the holiday season.
Professional Visualization revenue was up 108% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects higher sell-in to
partners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily due to stronger enterprise workstation
demand and the ramp of notebook workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture.
Automotive revenue was up 4% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects growth in sales of auto
cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms. The sequential increase was driven by sales of self-driving platforms.
Gross margin increased significantly from a year ago and sequentially, driven by improved product mix from Data Center revenue growth and
lower net inventory provisions and related charges.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, provisions for inventory and related charges were $681 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or
settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $239 million, primarily from Ampere GPU architecture
products. The net inventory provisions were $442 million and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 2.4 percentage points.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, provisions for inventory and related charges were $702 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or
settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $21 million. The net inventory provisions were $681
million and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 11.5 percentage points.
Operating expenses were up 16% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially, driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based
compensation, primarily reflecting growth in employees and compensation increases.

Compute & Networking - The increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2023 was due to higher Data Center revenue. Compute GPUs grew 369% year-on-year and 193% compared to the first
nine months of fiscal year 2023 led by strong demand for the NVIDIA HGX platform driven by global demand for the training and inferencing of
large language models, recommendation engines and inferencing of generative AI applications. Networking was up 155% year-on-year and 99%
compared to the first nine months of last year, almost entirely due to strong growth in InfiniBand infrastructure to support our HGX platform.
Graphics - The increase in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflects growth in Gaming GPUs
reflecting higher sell-in to partners following normalization of channel inventory levels earlier this year. The decrease in the first nine months of
fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 primarily reflects 57% lower enterprise graphics and 14% lower
Professional Visualization GPUs, partially offset by 7% growth in Gaming GPUs, following normalization of channel inventory levels earlier this
year.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating
expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized
in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities
that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding:

As of October 29, 2023, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was
not significant.
During the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting
treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 29, 2023 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited
consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, as filed with the SEC,
but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the
interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended January 29, 2023. 
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 29, 2023.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 are both 52-week years. The

Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk
Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.
Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 17Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):
Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended
June 25,
2022June 26,

Total operating expenses $ 12,809 $ 11,129 $ 38,144 $ 32,499 
Percentage of total net sales 15 % 14 % 13 % 12 %
Research and Development
The growth in research and development (“R&D ”) expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was
driven primarily by incre ases in headcount-related expenses, engineering program costs and professional services. The Company continues to believe that
focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the mark etplace, and to the development of new and updated products
and services that are central to the Company’ s core business strategy .
Selling, General and Administrative
The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was
driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, advertising and professional services.
Other Income/(Expense), Net
Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021 was as follows (dollars in millions):
Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended
June 25,

Other income/(expense), net (13) 189 (65) 585 
Total other income/(expense), net $ (10) $ 243 (104) %$ (97) $ 796 (112)%
OI&E decrea sed during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to fair value adjustments and
realized losses on marketable securities and higher interest expense, partially of fset by foreign exchange gains.
Provision for Income T axes
Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26,
2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):
Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended
June 25,

Provision for income taxes $ 3,624 $ 2,625 $ 15,364 $ 11,830 
Effective tax rate 15.7 % 10.8 % 16.3 % 13.8 %
Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % 21 %
The Compan y’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower
effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, partially offset by state
income taxes.
Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 18The Compan y’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on
foreign earnings and an adjustment to prior years’ foreign-derived intangible income deductions . The Company’ s effective tax rate for the first nine months of
2022 was higher compa red to the same period in 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, lower tax benefits from share-based
compensation, and the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Compa ny believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and
continued access to debt markets, will be suf ficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’ s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Compa ny utilizes several outsourcing partn ers to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’ s products and to perform final assembly and testing of
finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company , which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June 25, 2022, the
Company had manufac turing purchase obligations of $43.1 billion, with $43.0 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’ s manufacturing purchase
obligations are primarily noncancelable.
In addition to its contra ctual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase progra m authorized by the Board of Directors (the “Program”). The
Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 25, 2022, the Company’ s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per
share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of finan cial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’ s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’ s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Signific ant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to conden sed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Company’ s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’ s
critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes to the Company’ s market risk during the first nine months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company’ s exposure to market
risk, refer to the Compan y’s market risk disclosu res set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2021 Form
10-K.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’ s management, the Company’ s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Company’ s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Excha nge Act”) were effective as of June 25, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the Compa ny in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorde d, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’ s management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial of ficer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with
management’ s evaluatio n required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and

================ FILE: 2023 Q3 NVDA.pdf ================

income tax was an expense of 12.2% and 11.3% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and a
benefit of 10.9% and 2.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.
32The effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based
compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax
rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (4,457)$ 7,378 
Net cash used in financing activities $ (10,004)$ (9,961)
As of October 29, 2023, we had $18.28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, an increase of $4.99 billion from the end of
fiscal year 2023. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and
credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023,
due to growth in revenue, partially offset by higher accounts receivable balance and taxes paid. Accounts receivable balance in the third quarter
of fiscal year 2024 reflected approximately $570 million from customer payments received ahead of the invoice due date.
Cash provided by investing activities decreased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023,
primarily driven by lower marketable securities maturities.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, due
to a debt repayment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and higher tax payments related to RSUs, partially offset by lower share
repurchases.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of
October 29, 2023, we had $18.28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt
securities issued by the USG and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as
certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to
Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to
meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our debt obligations, future supply
obligations and vendor and supplier prepayments. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external
capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Except for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued
any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities held outside of the U.S. as of October 29, 2023 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
We
33paid $4.35 billion in cash taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, largely for previously deferred federal income tax payments related to the
disaster relief made available by the IRS for certain California taxpayers.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we returned $3.72 billion and $7.01 billion, respectively, in share repurchases
and $99 million and $296 million, respectively, in cash dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our
Board of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
On August 21, 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.00 billion, without
expiration. As of October 29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock
up to $25.24 billion. From October 30, 2023 through November 17, 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million shares for $366 million pursuant to a Rule
10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share
repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.
The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee
compensation made after December 31, 2022. This provision has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper
Our aggregate debt maturities as of October 29, 2023, by year payable, are as follows:
 October 29, 2023
 (In millions)
Due in one year $ 1,250 
Due in one to five years 2,250 
Due in five to ten years 2,750 
Due in greater than ten years 3,500 
Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs (44)
Net carrying amount 9,706 
Less short-term portion (1,249)
Total long-term portion $ 8,457 
We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 29, 2023, we had not issued any
commercial paper.
Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
We have unrecognized tax benefits of $1.10 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $115 million recorded in non-current income
tax payable as of October 29, 2023. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties
in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.
Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our
contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. Refer to Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our
operating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Note 3, Note 12, and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed

To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from
sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However , the Company may
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting conside rations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or
interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Compan y may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments, and may designate these instrume nts as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company ’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may enter into forward contracts, cross-currenc y swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. As of July 1, 2023, the maximum lengt h of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–
related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.(1)

Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 8The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accountin g hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in
foreign curre ncy exchan ge rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’ s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

The derivative assets above represent the Company’ s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally
enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from
contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective
counterparties to the Company’ s derivative contr acts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party
to the other . As of Septe mber 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-of f associated with the Company’ s derivative

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However , the Company may
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting conside rations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or
interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Compan y may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments, and may designate these instrume nts as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company ’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may enter into forward contracts, cross-currenc y swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. As of June 25, 2022, the Company’ s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized
within 20 years.
The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accountin g hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in
foreign curre ncy exchan ge rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’ s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
The notional amounts of the Company’ s outstanding derivative instruments as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):

twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This excludes revenue related to performance obligations for contracts with a length of one year or
less.
Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating
expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized
in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities
that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding:

The unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was not significant as of October 29, 2023 and
January 29, 2023.
As of October 29, 2023, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was
not significant.
During the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting
treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
Since our founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 has sparked the growth of
the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and has fueled industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA
is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
Our two operating segments are ""Compute & Networking"" and ""Graphics,"" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models
Demand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To
meet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaid
supply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our
supply chain may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity
arrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our
inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
25We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity
commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand
expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles or enter new lines of business, which may
require us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity.
Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners
prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the
architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch
cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges
associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers
anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can
create reductions or volatility in our revenue. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and
quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay
further production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our
technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we
have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,
may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.
We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist such as our Omniverse platform, third-

less.
Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating
expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized
in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities
that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding:

The unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was not significant as of October 29, 2023 and
January 29, 2023.
As of October 29, 2023, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was
not significant.
During the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting
treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.

ABOUT MARKET RISK
Investment and Interest Rate Risk
Financial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there have been no
material changes to the financial market risks described as of January 29, 2023.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
The impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there
have been no material changes to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 29, 2023.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of October 29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective to provide
reasonable assurance.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or
ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial
records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes
that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
NVIDIA have been detected.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our
legal proceedings since January 29, 2023. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 29, 2023 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
35ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 and Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarters ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, in Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters
ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023, and below. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results
of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or
that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
Failure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed
wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of
customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and
demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has
significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future
enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our
business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles
or enter new lines of business, which may require us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain
complexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties that are necessary
for the finished product are not available. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to
secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to
scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may
not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand
for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,
including:
•changes in product development cycles and time to market;
•competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;
•changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;
•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;
•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;
•new or unexpected end use cases;
•increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;
36•business decisions made by third parties;
•the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX cloud services;
•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
•the demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and
generative AI models; or
•government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
Demand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To
meet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with

================ FILE: 2023 Q3 NVDA.pdf ================

into next year. To
meet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers, and entered into prepaid
supply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our
supply chain, may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity
arrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our
inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product
transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our
channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of
transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data
Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify
the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products,
customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product
introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for
current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same
time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our
financial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges
and quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and
delay further production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our
technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we
have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,
may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.
Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple original equipment manufacturers, original device
manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple original equipment
manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market
conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly
forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to
increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase
production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience
supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at
all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally,
since some of our products are part of a
37complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader
revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our
competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a
reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a
result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our
products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also
written-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-
cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make
changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and
prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively
impact our gross margins and financial results.
We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as NVIDIA DGX cloud services,
NVIDIA AI Foundations, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new
use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate
significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while
they have driven increased demand for Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be
used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI
models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace
Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue
or supply levels.
Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead
times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical
tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract
manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.
The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and
can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years
ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable
degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for
our

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
Since our founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 has sparked the growth of
the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and has fueled industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA
is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
Our two operating segments are ""Compute & Networking"" and ""Graphics,"" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models
Demand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To
meet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaid

inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
25We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity
commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand

Total operating expenses $ 12,809 $ 11,129 $ 38,144 $ 32,499 
Percentage of total net sales 15 % 14 % 13 % 12 %
Research and Development
The growth in research and development (“R&D ”) expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was
driven primarily by incre ases in headcount-related expenses, engineering program costs and professional services. The Company continues to believe that
focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the mark etplace, and to the development of new and updated products
and services that are central to the Company’ s core business strategy .
Selling, General and Administrative
The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was
driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, advertising and professional services.
Other Income/(Expense), Net
Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021 was as follows (dollars in millions):
Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended

Other income/(expense), net (13) 189 (65) 585 
Total other income/(expense), net $ (10) $ 243 (104) %$ (97) $ 796 (112)%
OI&E decrea sed during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to fair value adjustments and
realized losses on marketable securities and higher interest expense, partially of fset by foreign exchange gains.
Provision for Income T axes
Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26,
2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):
Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended

Provision for income taxes $ 3,624 $ 2,625 $ 15,364 $ 11,830 
Effective tax rate 15.7 % 10.8 % 16.3 % 13.8 %
Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % 21 %
The Compan y’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower
effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, partially offset by state
income taxes.
Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 18The Compan y’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on
foreign earnings and an adjustment to prior years’ foreign-derived intangible income deductions . The Company’ s effective tax rate for the first nine months of
2022 was higher compa red to the same period in 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, lower tax benefits from share-based
compensation, and the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Compa ny believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and
continued access to debt markets, will be suf ficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’ s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Compa ny utilizes several outsourcing partn ers to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’ s products and to perform final assembly and testing of
finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company , which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June 25, 2022, the
Company had manufac turing purchase obligations of $43.1 billion, with $43.0 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’ s manufacturing purchase
obligations are primarily noncancelable.
In addition to its contra ctual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase progra m authorized by the Board of Directors (the “Program”). The
Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 25, 2022, the Company’ s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per
share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of finan cial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’ s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’ s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Signific ant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to conden sed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Company’ s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’ s
critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes to the Company’ s market risk during the first nine months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company’ s exposure to market
risk, refer to the Compan y’s market risk disclosu res set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2021 Form
10-K.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’ s management, the Company’ s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Company’ s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Excha nge Act”) were effective as of June 25, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the Compa ny in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorde d, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’ s management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial of ficer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with
management’ s evaluatio n required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and

and nine-month periods ended July 1, 2023 and June 25, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue
represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.
As of July 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively . As of July 1, 2023, the
Company expects 67% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 6% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater
than three years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However , the Company may
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting conside rations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or
interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Compan y may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments, and may designate these instrume nts as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company ’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may enter into forward contracts, cross-currenc y swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. As of July 1, 2023, the maximum lengt h of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–
related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.(1)

assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’ s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

The derivative assets above represent the Company’ s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally
enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from
contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective
counterparties to the Company’ s derivative contr acts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party
to the other . As of Septe mber 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-of f associated with the Company’ s derivative

Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www .apple.com, and its investor relations website,
investor .apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate
governance matters, and details related to the Company’ s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form
10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further , the Company’ s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only .
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday
demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product
introductions can also impact the Company’ s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product
launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Quarterly Highlights
Total net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of
Services and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022.
At the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Com pany introduced an all-new MacBook Air and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro , both powe red by the new
Apple M2 chip. The Company also announced iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to its operating systems that are expe cted to be

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with U.S. GAAP , consistent in all material respects with those applied
in our 2021 Form 10-K and as updated by our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2022.
We have made estimates and judgments af fecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we
experience may dif fer

billion and
$187 million in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $(11.5) billion and $(280) million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, from our equity investment in
Rivian.
Income Taxes
Our income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $2.1 billion, which included $3.2 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily
attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.8 billion,
which included $306 million of net discrete tax benefits. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 7 — Income Taxes” for additional information.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain
non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet
the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.
We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property
and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following
is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing
twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in millions):
 Twelve Months Ended

Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (59,061) (53,963)
Free cash flow $ (23,487)$ 7,878 
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (38,580)$ (51,908)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 740 $ 2,917 
28Table of Contents
Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations
Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance
leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual
payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance
leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing twelve
months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in millions):

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (38,580)$ (51,908)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 740 $ 2,917 
Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by
equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and
modifications,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal
repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired
under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a
reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most
comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in
millions):

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 740 $ 2,917 
___________________
(1)For the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance
leases, net of remeasurements and modifications” of $3,579 million and $696 million.
(2)For the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $9,789
million and $5,705 million.
29Table of Contents
All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the
residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments
representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or
other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire
consolidated statements of cash flows.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates
Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided
to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on
our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):

of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued
active employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award
Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any
proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of
absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as
approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal
leave of absence.
Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the
Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain
employed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to
terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other
compensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant
without the Participant’s consent thereto.
15. Dividend and Voting Rights.
(a) Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no
dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the
RSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the
Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the
book entry evidencing such Shares.
(b) Dividend Equivalent Rights Distributions. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its
Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its
Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan)
subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend
Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other
terms, conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided,
however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend
Equivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total target number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving
effect to Exhibit A. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which,
immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit
A.
6. Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any
interest therein or amount or Shares payable in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,
alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.
7. Timing and Manner of Payment of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following the Vesting Date pursuant to
Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the
Participant a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, as
determined by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest (or, in the case of the Participant’s
Retirement, death or Disability, are treated as vesting) on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related Items, unless such RSUs terminate prior to the
Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested RSUs is
subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested
RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The
Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.
8. Effect of Termination of Service.
(a) Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend
Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Termination of Service, meaning
the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Severance Date”),
regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the
Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date.
2(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided by the Committee, in the event of the Participant’s
Termination of Service due to the Participant’s Retirement (defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date, death or Disability,
any unvested RSUs shall continue to be eligible to vest on the Vesting Date without regard to the Participant’s Termination of Service. For
purposes of this Award Agreement, “Retirement” means the Participant’s Termination of Service on or after the Participant both has reached the
age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10) years of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary (including service with any entity acquired by
the Company), as of the Severance Date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In the event the Participant’s Termination of
Service occurs due to Retirement prior to the first anniversary of the Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, unless the Committee shall
otherwise determine.
(c) If any unvested RSUs are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend
Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent that any RSUs remain
outstanding following the Severance Date by reason of Section 8(b) but the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied,
such RSUs shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A) without payment of any consideration
by the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.
9. Recoupment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be
issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of
any such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with U.S. GAAP , consistent in all material respects with those applied
in our 2021 Form 10-K and as updated by our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2022.
We have made estimates and judgments af fecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we
experience may dif fer

billion and
$187 million in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $(11.5) billion and $(280) million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, from our equity investment in
Rivian.
Income Taxes
Our income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $2.1 billion, which included $3.2 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily
attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.8 billion,
which included $306 million of net discrete tax benefits. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 7 — Income Taxes” for additional information.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain
non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet
the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.
We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property
and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following
is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing
twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in millions):
 Twelve Months Ended
June 30,
 2022 2023
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 35,574 $ 61,841 
Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (59,061) (53,963)
Free cash flow $ (23,487)$ 7,878 
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (38,580)$ (51,908)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 740 $ 2,917 
28Table of Contents
Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations
Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance
leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual
payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance
leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing twelve
months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in millions):
 Twelve Months Ended

 2022 2023

Free cash flow (23,487) 7,878 
Principal repayments of finance leases (9,789) (5,705)
Principal repayments of financing obligations (205) (244)
Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations $ (33,481) 1,929 
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (38,580)$ (51,908)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 740 $ 2,917 
Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by
equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and
modifications,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal
repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired
under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a
reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most
comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in
millions):

Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (1,621) (269)
Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (751) (631)
Principal repayments of financing obligations (205) (244)
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing
obligations $ (26,064)$ 6,734 
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (38,580)$ (51,908)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 740 $ 2,917 
___________________
(1)For the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance
leases, net of remeasurements and modifications” of $3,579 million and $696 million.
(2)For the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $9,789
million and $5,705 million.
29Table of Contents
All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the
residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments
representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or
other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire
consolidated statements of cash flows.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates
Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided
to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on
our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):

9.
(c) In lieu of issuing fractional Common Shares, on the vesting of a fraction of an SA, the Company shall round the shares down to the
nearest whole share and any such share that represents a fraction of a SA will be included in a subsequent vest date.
(d) Until the distribution to Awardee of the Common Shares in respect of the vested SAs is evidenced by deposit in Awardee’s brokerage
account, Awardee shall have no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to such Common Shares,
notwithstanding the vesting of SAs. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date
Awardee is recorded as the owner of the Common Shares, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.
(e) By accepting the Award of SAs evidenced by this Award Agreement, Awardee agrees not to sell any of the Common Shares received on
account of vested SAs at a time when applicable laws or Company policies prohibit a sale. This restriction shall apply so long as Awardee is
an Employee, Consultant or outside director of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Award Agreement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold applicable taxes by
withholding fractional Shares.
10. Non-Transferability of SAs. Awardee’s right in the SAs awarded under this Award Agreement and any interest therein may not be sold,
pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner, other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution. SAs
shall not be subject to execution, attachment or other process.
 
11. Acknowledgment of Nature of Plan and SAs. In accepting the Award, Awardee acknowledges that:
(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated
by the Company at any time, as provided in the Plan;
(b) the Award of SAs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future awards of SAs or other
awards, or benefits in lieu of SAs even if SAs have been awarded repeatedly in the past;
(c) all decisions with respect to SAs or other future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
(d) Awardee’s participation in the Plan is voluntary;
(e) the future value of the underlying Common Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(f) if Awardee receives Common Shares, the value of the Common Shares acquired on vesting of SAs may increase or decrease in value;
(g) notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the Plan to the contrary and consistent with Section 4 above, in the event of termination of
Awardee's Continuous Status as a Participant under circumstances where Section 7 above does not apply (whether or not in breach of
applicable laws), Awardee's right to receive SAs and vest under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Awardee is no
longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under applicable law. Awardee's right to receive Common
Shares pursuant to any SAs after termination of Continuous Status as a Participant, if any, will be calculated as of the date of termination of
Awardee's active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under applicable law. The senior corporate officer in
charge of the Human Resources department shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Awardee is no longer actively employed
for purposes of the award of SAs; and
(h) Awardee acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether Awardee is terminated with or without cause, notice or pre-termination
procedure or whether Awardee asserts or prevails on a claim that Awardee’s employment was terminable only for cause or only with notice
or pre-termination procedure, Awardee has no right to, and will not bring any legal claim or action for, (a) any damages for any portion of any
SAs that have been vested and converted into Common Shares, or (b) termination of any unvested SAs under this Award Agreement.
12. No Employment Right. Awardee acknowledges that neither the fact of this Award of SAs nor any provision of this Award Agreement or
the Plan or the policies adopted pursuant to the Plan shall confer upon Awardee any right with respect to employment or continuation of
current employment with the Company or with Awardee’s actual employer, or to employment that is not terminable at will. Awardee further
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Plan nor this Award of SAs makes Awardee's employment with the Company or Awardee’s actual
employer for any minimum or fixed period, and that this employment is subject to the mutual consent of Awardee and the Company or
Awardee’s actual employer, and may be terminated by either Awardee or the Company or Awardee’s actual employer at any time, for any
reason or no reason, with or without cause or notice or any kind of pre- or post-termination warning, discipline or procedure.
13. Administration. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the authority to manage and control the operation and administration

held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to
Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s favor, for the purpose of
managing and administering the Plan (“Data”). The Company and its related entities may transfer Data amongst themselves as necessary for
the purpose of implementation, administration and management of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, and the Company and its related
entities may each further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the implementation, administration
and management of the Plan. The Participant acknowledges that the transferors and transferees of such Data may be located anywhere in the
world and hereby authorizes each of them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of
implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s participation in the Plan, including any transfer of such Data as may be required for
the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of Shares on the Participant’s behalf to a broker or to other third party with whom
the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired under the Plan (whether pursuant to the Award or otherwise).
14. Notices. Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Company at its
principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the Participant’s last address reflected on the Company’s records, or at
such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the
Participant is no longer an employee of the Company, shall be deemed to have been duly given by the Company when enclosed in a properly
sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office
or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government.
15. Plan. The Award and all rights of the Participant under this Award Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the
provisions of the Plan, incorporated herein by reference. The Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement.
The Participant acknowledges having read and understood the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Award Agreement. Unless otherwise
expressly provided in other sections of this Award Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the
Committee do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are
otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Committee under the Plan
after the date hereof.
516. Entire Agreement. This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior
understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award
Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company. The
Company may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the
Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any
other provision hereof.
17. Limitation on the Participant’s Rights. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This
Award Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as
creating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Participant shall have only the rights of a
general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the RSUs, and rights
no greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured creditor with respect to RSUs, as and when payable hereunder.
18. Section Headings. The section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed
to alter or affect any provision hereof.
19. Governing Law. This Award Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of California without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder.
20. Choice of Venue. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties
evidenced by this grant or this Award Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that
such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the Northern District of California,
and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.
21. Construction. It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A
of the Code. This Award Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.
22. Severability. The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of more provisions are determined to be illegal
or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
23. Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant’s
participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

6PERFORMANCE AWARD
EXHIBIT A
PERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS
The RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined based on
the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) Percentile for the Performance Period.
The percentage of the RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting Date will be determined as follows:
•If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs
will vest on the Vesting Date.
•If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on
the Vesting Date.
•If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on
the Vesting Date.
•If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the RSUs will vest on the
Vesting Date.
For TSR Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, the portion of the RSUs that will vest
on the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated
above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is negative, in no event shall more than one hundred
percent (100%) of the target RSUs vest.
The number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and the balance of the RSUs will not vest
and will terminate on that Vesting Date.
 For purposes of the Award, the following definitions will apply:
•“TSR Percentile” means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs for the

eliminate your tax liability .
9. Election to Defer Receipt of RSU Shares . You may elect to defer receipt of shares of Common Stock relating to an RSU beyond the
vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant under the rules and procedures established separately by the Corporation. That election will allow
you to defer income recognition, until the date on which your service as a member of the Corporation’ s Board of Directors terminates for any
reason. Under Internal Reve nue Code Section 409A, the election to defer under this section must be made in the calendar year prior to the year in
which services related to those RSU’ s are first performed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shares of Common Stock
will not be issued and you will not have any rights of a stockholder in Commo n Stock issuable under this Agreement to the extent that you have
elected to defer the issuance and receip t of such Common Stock. If, however , your service as a member of the Corporation’ s Board of Directors
terminates prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, any shares that would not have vested on your date of termination will be
cancelled regardless of your election. Notwithstanding your election to defer made in the calendar year prior to grant, the Corporation is not
obligated to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation might make a grant
in any future year or in any given amount.
10. Rights as Stockholder . Your RSU s may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in
any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer ,
assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, will be void and unenforceable against the Corporation.
You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs
and satisfa ction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a
stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to
this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares.
11. Amendments . The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation
to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan.
12. Data Privacy . You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer , in electronic or other form, of your
personal data as described in this document and any other RSU grant materials (“Data”) by and among, the Corporation and any other
Subsidiary for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan.
-3-
 
You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal informat ion about you, including, but not limited to, your name,
home address and telephone number , date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number , salary , nationality , job title, any
shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled,
exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan. You
hereby understand that Data will be transferred E*Trade and any other third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and
management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’ s country (e.g., the
United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country . You hereby understand that you may request a list with
the names and addr esses of any potent ial recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the
Corporation, E*Trade and any other possible recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for
the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of
such Data as may be required to another broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock
acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage
your parti cipation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the
storage and processing of Data, requir e any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without
cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative.
Further , you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later
seek to revoke your consent, your service with the Company will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your
consent is that the Corporation would not be able to grant you RSUs or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore,
you hereb y understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more
information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human
resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level.
Finally , upon request of the Corporati on, you agree to provide an executed data privacy consent form (or any other agreements or
consents) that the Corporation may deem necessary to obtain from you for the purpose of administering your participation in the 2006 Plan in
compliance with the data privacy laws in your country , either now or in the future. You understand and agree that you will not be able to
participate in the 2006 Plan if you fail to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Corporation. 
13. The 2006 Plan and Other T erms; Other Matters .
(a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or
negotiations concern ing the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006
Plan has been made available to you.
The grant of RSUs to you in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation to make a grant in any future year or in
any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount.
(b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corp oration, and as required by the laws of your
country of residence, only authorized but unissued shares thereof will be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof.
-4-
 
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in law or the financial or tax accounting rules
applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement will occur , the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, (1) modify this Agreement to impose
such restrictions or procedures with respect to the RSUs (whether vested or unvested), the shares issued or issuable pursuant to the RSUs and/or
any proceeds or payments from or relating to such shares as it determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or to
address, comply with or offset the econ omic effect to the Corporation of any accounting or administrative matters relating thereto, or (2) cancel
and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating
expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized
in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities
that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 30, 2022 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited
consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC,
but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the
interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended January 30, 2022.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged
across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.
The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of
making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related
and other costs, corporate infrastructure and support costs, restructuring costs, acquisition termination cost, IP-related and legal settlement
costs, contributions, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense
directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate
depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue.
The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our
reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with U.S. GAAP , consistent in all material respects with those applied
in our 2021 Form 10-K and as updated by our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2022.
We have made estimates and judgments af fecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we
experience may dif fer

billion and
$187 million in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $(11.5) billion and $(280) million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, from our equity investment in
Rivian.
Income Taxes
Our income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $2.1 billion, which included $3.2 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily
attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.8 billion,
which included $306 million of net discrete tax benefits. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 7 — Income Taxes” for additional information.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain
non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet
the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.
We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property
and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following
is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing
twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in millions):
 Twelve Months Ended

Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (59,061) (53,963)
Free cash flow $ (23,487)$ 7,878 
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (38,580)$ (51,908)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 740 $ 2,917 
28Table of Contents
Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations
Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance
leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual
payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance
leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing twelve
months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in millions):

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (38,580)$ (51,908)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 740 $ 2,917 
Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by
equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and
modifications,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal
repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired
under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a
reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most
comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in
millions):

(1)For the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance
leases, net of remeasurements and modifications” of $3,579 million and $696 million.
(2)For the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $9,789
million and $5,705 million.
29Table of Contents
All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the
residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments
representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or
other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire
consolidated statements of cash flows.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates
Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided
to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on
our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):

Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase
obligations”). The Company’ s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and
distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of July 1, 2023, are
as follows (in millions):
2023 (remaining three months) $ 1,260

Thereafter 8,198 
Total $ 18,957 
Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a
material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 13Item 2. Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on
certain assu mptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding
the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’ s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forwa rd-looking
statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates, ” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”
“can,” “may ,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’ s actual results may differ significantly
from the results discusse d in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,
Item 1A of the Company’ s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”
The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law .
Unless otherwise stated , all information present ed herein is based on the Company’ s fiscal calendar , and references to particular years, quarters, months or
periods refer to the Company’ s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the
“Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www .apple.com, and its investor relations website,
investor .apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance
matters, and details related to the Company’ s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not
incorporated by reference into this filing. Further , the Company’ s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only .
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday
demand. Additionally , new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales , cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product
introductions can also impact the Company’ s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product
launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer produ ct approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Fiscal Period
The Compan y’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September . An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’ s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’ s fiscal years
2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively .
Quarterly Highlights
Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Com pany’ s total net sales, which decreased 1% or $1.2 billion during
the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPad and
iPhone, partially of fset by higher net sales of Services.
During the third quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products:
•15-inch MacBook Air, powered by the M2 chip;
•Mac Studio™, powered by the M2 Max chip and the new M2 Ultra chip;
•Mac Pro , powered by the new M2 Ultra chip; and
•Apple V ision Pro™, the Company’ s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS™, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024.
The Company also anno unced iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to its opera ting systems that are expected to be
available in the fall of 2023.®

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The conden sed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”).
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’ s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumpti ons that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materi ally from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’ s presentation. These condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’ s annual consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021.
The Compan y’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September . An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’ s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Com pany’ s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless
otherwise stated, references to particular years , quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’ s fiscal years ended in September and the associated
quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
